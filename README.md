# Caffe SegNet iOS

This project was a small test to see if SegNet is able to run on an iPhone. It does work, but the inference takes way too much time and memory. I managed it to run on an iPhone X. The inference needs approximility 4GB of memory.

The repo here is just for anybody who want to do futher tests.

The build system of this repo is based on the project [caffe-mobile](https://github.com/solrex/caffe-mobile)
of @solrex.

**This is a modified version of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) which supports the [SegNet architecture](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/) on iOS**

## Compile SegNet

To compile SegNet, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gi097/segnet-ios.git
$ ./tools/build_ios.sh
```
